# Architecture Standards for Component Development

## Core Component Principles

### Component Design Requirements
- **Self-Managing Components**: Every component must manage its own lifecycle, state, and dependencies
- **Memory Safety**: Use predefined object types with strict type checking and memory-safe patterns
- **Interface Contracts**: Implement concrete adapters of well-defined interfaces with documented contracts
- **Type Ownership**: Each component owns ALL its types through its interface definition - no external type dependencies
- **Dependency Management**: Apply dependency inversion and injection patterns consistently
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Components communicate through documented channels and emit subscribable events

### Fractal Architecture Pattern
- Design each functional area as a self-managing component that can operate independently
- Each component should be exportable as a standalone open-source library package
- Ensure components are composable building blocks for larger applications
- Maintain consistent interfaces across all abstraction levels

## Component Organization Architecture

### Standard Component Structure
```
component/
├── interface.ts          # ALL types + contracts for this component
├── adapter.ts           # Concrete implementation using interface types
├── mocks.ts             # Official mocks/stubs/test doubles for this component
├── component.test.ts    # Tests using local mocks and test utilities
└── README.md           # Documentation including type contracts and mock usage
```

### Type System Architecture
- **No External Type Dependencies**: Components must never depend on external type packages or shared type files
- **Interface-Defined Types**: All component types must be defined within the component's interface definition
- **Complete Type Ecosystem**: Each component's interface must include:
  - Primary business logic types
  - Input/output contract types
  - Event emission/subscription schemas
  - Configuration and initialization types
  - Testing utilities (mocks, partials, stubs)
  - Dependency injection types for testing

### Mock and Test Double Standards
- **Component-Owned Mocks**: Each component must provide its own official mocks/stubs/test doubles
- **Canonical Test Doubles**: Component authors define how their component should be mocked for consumers
- **Mock-Interface Consistency**: Mocks must be maintained alongside interface changes
- **Consumer Mock Imports**: Other components import official mocks rather than creating ad-hoc test doubles

## UI/UX Architecture Patterns

## Integration with Development Methodology
This architecture specification works in conjunction with the AI Agent Development Methodology document to define what to build (this document) and how to build it (methodology document). Together, they provide comprehensive guidance for creating enterprise-grade, reusable component ecosystems.
