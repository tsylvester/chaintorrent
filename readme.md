This is not the currently active build repo for the system. At the moment it's only for easy access to the core concept documentation.

The actual live repo is currently hosted at https://github.com/tsylvester/paynless-framework/, the main branch is /desktop/ but it hasn't merged recently with the most-recent feature addition branch /wallet-backend/ 

I haven't been working on it directly yet because I've diverted to setting up the toolchain that will maximize contributors' abilities to support the project with the AI dialect I'm building in the paynless repo to help professional coders adopt agentic coding agents without fucking up their code base. 

Email me for details. I'm not hard to reach. I use my real name everywhere and you could guess my email address even if you had severe brain damage.
